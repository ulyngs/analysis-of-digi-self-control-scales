MI: I like the alternate actually, as I think the Qs shoudl pertain to all devices not just the one they most use
KL: I prefer the current item when you can generate dynamically based on the devices they use, but the alternate is simpler to implement and works too. 

KL: One side question: are we intentionally excluding other digital devices, i.e., gaming consoles, smart speakers, VR headsets, internet-connected TVs, etc.? These are clearly digital devices, so we should have some rationale for including/excluding, which might just be that our workshop interventions aren't targeted towards those devices?",,

Items on their factor 3, ""Risky and Impulsive Internet Use"":
Allow time on the internet to negatively affect your school performance
Lose motivation to do other things that need to get done 
Neglect responsibilities
Avoid other activities in order to stay online
Put internet use in front of important, everyday activities
Lose sleep due to nighttime internet use
Use the internet excessively

In general, the things researchers talk about in relation to risky behaviour online are ""[exposure] to a variety of sexual and violent material, financial scams, cyber bullying, harassment, and the risk of meeting dangerous people or even sexual predators"" https://journals.lww.com/cinjournal/fulltext/2011/06000/Risky_Internet_Behaviors_of_Middle_School.6.aspx 

Kai: Two quick thoughts here re: adapting these SS items for digital self-control:
1) It seems that these items come from another scale (the Zuckerman SSS-V) that itself has subscales: https://scienceofbehaviorchange.org/measures/zuckerman-sensation-seeking-scale-v/ We might want to try to make our adapted items also capture items that fit with those corresponding subscales.
2) Maybe there's already a scale of ""sensation-seeking online"" or ""risky behaviors online"" that we can borrow/adapt from? ",,
